Quantum Image Generation with Qiskit and GAN

Project Overview

This project combines quantum computing techniques using Qiskit with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images based on textual prompts. The core idea is to leverage the unique capabilities of quantum circuits to enhance image generation diversity and quality.

Key Concepts

1. Quantum Circuits: Utilizes Qiskit to create quantum circuits that process latent inputs derived from prompts.


2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Employs neural networks (generator and discriminator) that work together to improve image generation.


3. Feature Extraction: Quantum circuits extract features from textual prompts, which are used by the GAN for image creation.



Applications

Creative Industries: Automating art and content generation for marketing, advertising, and entertainment.

Data Augmentation: Generating synthetic images for training machine learning models, improving performance on limited datasets.

Research: Exploring the intersection of quantum computing and deep learning for advanced image processing techniques.
